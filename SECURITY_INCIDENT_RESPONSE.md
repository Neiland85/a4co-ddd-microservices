   ```nginx
   # Nginx - Block CVE-2025-29927
   if ($http_x_middleware_subrequest) {
       return 403 "Security violation detected";
   }
   proxy_set_header x-middleware-subrequest "";
   ```

2. **CDN/WAF Rules**
   ```javascript
   // Cloudflare Worker Protection
   if (request.headers.get('x-middleware-subrequest')) {
     return new Response('Security violation detected', { status: 403 });
   }
   ```

### Monitoring & Detection
1. **Security Event Logging**
   - Real-time attack detection
   - IP address tracking
   - Request pattern analysis
   - Security incident alerts

2. **Automated Scanning**
   - Pre-commit secret scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability checks
   - Code security analysis
   - False positive filtering
