# Workflows disabled for ultimate simplification - Saturday, 4 de January de 2026, 06:38 UTC

All GitHub Actions workflows have been disabled to achieve maximum simplification of CI/CD runners.

Workflows moved to: .github/workflows-disabled/
- ci.yml → ci.yml.disabled
- e2e.yml → e2e.yml.disabled  
- deploy-production.yml → deploy-production.yml.disabled

Replacement: Local cleanup and setup scripts
- scripts/cleanup.sh - Clean build artifacts
- scripts/cleanup-deep.sh - Deep cleanup including node_modules
- scripts/setup-complete.sh - Complete setup from scratch

Package.json commands added:
- pnpm run clean - Run cleanup script
- pnpm run clean:deep - Run deep cleanup script
- pnpm run setup - Run complete setup script

Benefits:
- Zero GitHub Actions runner costs
- Faster local development
- Complete control over build/test/deploy
- Simpler architecture
- Local-first workflow

To re-enable workflows, copy files from .github/workflows-disabled/ back to .github/workflows/
